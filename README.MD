#### {A web application to detect if something is a triangle}, {14-09-2018}
#### By **Jeremy Kimotho**
## Description
My web app takes either three angles or three sides. It will assess the values you input and tell you if the values you put in would make a scalene, isosceles, equilateral triangle or not a triangle at all. It does this by using the rules of a triangle -all angles equal 180 and the sum of two sides is equal to or larger than the third.
## BDD

* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
