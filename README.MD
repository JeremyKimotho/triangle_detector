## Description
My web app takes either three angles or three sides. It will assess the values you input and tell you if the values you put in would make a scalene, isosceles, equilateral triangle or not a triangle at all. It does this by using the rules of a triangle -all angles equal 180 and the sum of two sides is equal to or larger than the third.
## BDD
* I first had to make textboxes and input fields to collect the data.
* I then had to create a way to trigger my function running once the data was collected, I did this using a button.
* The function that calculated if it was a triangle and what type, needed to be able to only collect number data types, and no letters and so i made the input type number.
* To ensure users understand what type of values need to be inputted the page has a diagram to direct users which values mean what.
* After clicking the button that triggered the running of a function, I then had to find a way to write the function. With the angle calculator, I used the law that all triangles equal 180 degrees. Afterwards, I had to include an if inside of this if, this would tell you what kind of triangle it was. If the triangle didn't add up to 180, it did not even proceed to this and instead will immediately say 'This is not a triangle'.
